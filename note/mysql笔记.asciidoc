=== Explain
==== type
* *system*: the table has only one row
* *const*: the table has at most one matching row. Occuried on using PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE index 
* *eq_ref*: one row is read from this table for each combination of rows from the previous tables. it's the best possible join type.
* *ref: inedx* is used but it's not a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE index
* *fulltext*: the join is performed using a FULLTEXT index
* *ref_or_null*: MYSQL does an extra search for rows that contains NULL values
* *range*: Only rows thar are in a given range are retrieved, using an index to select the rows
* *index*: same as ALL, except that the index tree is scanned. Occurs two ways: 
  ** the index is a covering index and only the index tree is scanned
  ** a full table scan is performed using reads from the index to look up data rows in index order
* *all*: full table scan
